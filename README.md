# Implementing an Open Source Help Desk Ticketing System
In this project I will be implementing a help desk ticketing system - from the setup, workflows and more

## Why am I doing this?
I have a vast background in technology ranging from web development to cybersecurity - but I don't have many projects that display my general Information Technology capabilities. I would like to find a position in the IT field and I know that this would be a fun project for me to display my ability to implement critical IT technologies.
